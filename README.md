## AlarmSMS
This Android app is able eg. activate, deactivate and check status of the housealarm by sending an SMS with your alarm code and the status code. Afterwards, you will receive an SMS with a response message from your alarm.

## Garagedoor
This project is able to control your Nice garagedoor by using an Arduino to give an impulse in a wire to the Nice.
Furthermore, I have extended the project by making a project in Google AppInventor 2 to communicate with the Arduino.
